            **Welcome to the walkthrough of my final year project!**  
            

            My two college friends and I worked together, under the guidance of our university professor, with the objective of:
              -  Contributing to ongoing efforts to improve mental health care practices by reviewing literature on depression detection in Social media. 
              -  Collecting and analyzing recent depression related posts on Reddit to recognize the root causes of depression effectively. 
              -  Evaluating performance of several ML and DL models in classifying depression content. 

              
            Check out the best-performing depression predicting model of our project by pasting a Reddit post or maybe... writing how was your day ü§ó

I'm scared that people i know will see I'm not normal because any time I manage to feel happy I just get numb and feel awful right after, I can't stop telling myself how useless I am and I want to cry, it feels like only sh helps me then. Then I feel horrible to doing it and I do it again to punish myself I know nobody's going to see this I just had to say it to someone, it feels so bad when I'm numb and empty inside and I have to fake the happiness I felt for real just a minute ago")
